CODE CHALLENGE WEEK 1
======================

DESCRIPTION

The code challenge for week one had three toy problems. The first being student grade generator, the second being speed detector and finally net salary calculator. Each of these problem required me to write programs in JavaScript that perform the specific calculations based on the the input of the user. More description of each problem is as below:

Student Grade Generator
=======================
Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 

A > 79
B - 60 to 79
C -  59 to 49
D - 40 to 49
E - less than 40.
