# CODE CHALLENGE WEEK 1

# DESCRIPTION

The code challenge for week one had three toy problems. The first being student grade generator, the second being speed detector and finally net salary calculator. Each of these problem required me to write programs in JavaScript that perform the specific calculations based on the the input of the user. More description of each problem is as below:

# Student Grade Generator

Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade:

A > 79<br>
B - 60 to 79<br>
C - 59 to 49<br>
D - 40 to 49<br>
E - less than 40.

# Speed Detector

Write a program that prompts the user to input their speed and takes that input and determine if the driver is exceeding the speed limit which is set at 70 km/h. If the speed is below or equal to 70km/h the program prints "OK" and if the speed is above the speed limit the program calculates the total demerit points the driver has based on the instruction:
For every 5km/h above the speed limit,one demerit point is given.
The program prints the total demerit points and if they are equal to or exceed 12 points the program prints "Licence suspended".
